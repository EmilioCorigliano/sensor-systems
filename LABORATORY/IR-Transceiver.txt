working properly

RECEIVER:
- call HAL_UART_Receive_IT to enable to wait for a character
- when a char is received, the callback is called: here we start
the transmission to the UART connected to the PC

TRANSMITTER:
> TIM2 channel 3: linked to the Infra-Red led; generates a modulated signal at 38kHz
> TIM11: used to follow the given baudrate (2400 Hz -> 2400 bit/s)
- start the TIM11 timer to start the transmission of chars
- for each byte:
	. wait until the previous byte has been transmitted (wait for "sending" flag to be resetted)
	. set the sending flag, set the bit index to -1
	. following the baudrate, send the byte using the UART protocol:
		* send start bit[modulated],
		* for each bit, if it is low modulates, otherwise led stays down;
		* sends the stop bit (led stays down);
		* at the next cycle resets the "sending" flag;
